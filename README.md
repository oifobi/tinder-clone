Deliverables


The final product will be a client-side (just front-end) application created using ReactJS. The application will be what is called a content generator, in which it has a form on the left side and on the right side it will show the final generated content.



Each form field on the left side is responsible for a specific part of the content, so when user clicks from available options of each field, they will get the content generated on the right side.



Solution


- An npm package will be created, and using React and Webpack installed we will get a fully working React build system.
- The React context API will be uses as a central state management where we keep all the form values
